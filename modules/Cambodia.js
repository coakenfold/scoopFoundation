        Cambodia is where the SCOOP story begins, when Andy came across an under - resourced, single classroom school just outside Phnom Penh back in 2008. Upon returning home to Ireland, Andy began running events on their behalf, raising funds to build more classrooms
        for what would become the SCAO I School.He also encouraged qualified Teachers and Development Studies graduates to live there, helping them build up the school and the organisation itself. </p> 
        
        <p>
        The SCAO(link to the SCAO page) is now one of the hardest working local NGOs in and around Phnom Penh and together we plan to build more schools and reach more children. </p> 
        
        <p> ** (Possible slideshow of pics showing the first pic all the way through to the opening of the latest school ? ) ** < /p > < p >
        In 2011, together we built a new school from scratch– the SCAO II School - and at the tail end of 2016 a third school was constructed and opened - SCAO III - this time alongside other NGOs and altruists from all around the world. </p>

        <h3> The future ? </h3>

        <p>
        To continue building schools farther into Cambodia’ s countryside(which is 80 % of the country), in order to stop the migration of uneducated young people and children to its cities - who sadly find themselves vulnerable and desperate
        for work, usually finding it in low paid garment factories or in the vast amount of‘ girly’ bars and brothels where young women, men and children are exploited daily. </p>
