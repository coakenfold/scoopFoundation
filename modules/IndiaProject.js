        <h1>The Jeevan Village</h1>
        <br />
        <p>Moving on from the incredible work done at The Jeevan School, we have already purchased 2 acres of land outside the city (from a campaign run a couple years back) and plan to build a brand new village, designed for the children alone.</p>

        <p>The centre will offer a home to 100 children and a school to over 500 more.</p>

        <p>The plan is to build classrooms, bedrooms, gardens and courtyards – a series of living and learning spaces that are all built with children’s development at heart.</p>
         
        <p>It will also be self-sustainable – with solar energy, an organic farm and innovative waste disposal techniques.</p>
         
        <p>It will offer pre-nursery to pre-university level schooling, an infirmary and workshops, staff, student and volunteer accommodation, a family support centre, computer room, library, creativity area, multiple gardens, kitchens, canteens, and recreational amenities.</p>
         
        <p>There will be classrooms for English, Science and Maths, and yoga will be enjoyed each morning </p>
