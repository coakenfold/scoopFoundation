    <p>We also want to build quality accommodation to attract qualified teachers and Development Study graduates to come and live in village. </p>

    <p>To get involved, get in touch with Andy today, make a donation (link to DONATE page) or set up a fundraising page (link to Just Giving Page) on our behalf.</p>
